# PMS  - Arduino Based Patient Monitoring System
This is a repo - for a Arduino based simple and basic Patient Monitoring System. 

We will be monitoring vital parameters such as Temperature, Heart Rate and Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) using Arduino
The parameters measured will be displayed on both serial monitor and 16*2 LCD screen.

1. Circuit Diagram
2. Code

You will need to install a new library for this to work - 
MAX30100_PulseOximeter.h

Others are in-built.
